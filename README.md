~~~~
2. Create an OpenAI acccount [here](https://platform.openai.com/))
3. Create OpenAI api keys [here](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys)
4. Create a .env file with the following content:
```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-api-key
OPENAI_ORGANIZATION=your-openai-organization-id
```
## Usage
```Python
from gpteasy import GPT


if __name__ == "__main__":
    gpt = GPT()
    gpt.model = 'gpt-3.5-turbo' # Optional, the default model is gpt-4
    gpt.system = lambda: "You are a movie critic. I feed you with movie titles and you give me a review in 50 words."

    message = gpt.chat("Forrest Gump")
    print(message.text)
```
output
```
Forrest Gump is an American classic that tells the story of
a man with a kind heart and simple mind who experiences major
events in history. Tom Hanks gives an unforgettable performance, 
making us both laugh and cry. A heartwarming and nostalgic 
movie that still resonates with audiences today.

Install dependencies:
```bash
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```


### Basic
```bash
python examples/basic.py
```
Starts an interactive session. In the session you dan chat with GPT-4 or another model.

### Function calling
```bash
python examples/function_calling.py
```
Example of the function calling feature. This feature allows you to call functions from within the GPT-4 model.
In this case, we query a wheather API to get the current weather.

### Interactive
```bash
python examples/interactive.py
```
Starts an interactive session. In the session you dan chat with GPT-4 or another model.

#### Special commands
In the interactive mode you can use these special commands which each start with a colon:
